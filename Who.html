      <hr class="twoblockcomp">
  <p>I was born on January 27 2006 in st.michales hospital. My first two schools were Golden Orchard Montessori School and Burnhamthorpe Public school, since I was in pre k and kindergarten I donâ€™t have much recollection of those years but from what
    I am told I was a pretty bratty kid. After moving a couple of times I finally settled in terracotta and started going to Creditveiw public school, the school was very small having only 83 students at one point, it is the school I attended until
    grade 5. In 2017 the school was deemed to have too low of a population to be worth maintaining and it was shut down. After Creditveiw shut down, I moved to Befountain for grade 6, and I was deemed to be enhanced at the end of the year. Because I
    was deemed enhanced so I was transferred to Caledon East for grades 7 and 8. Which leads me to where I am today, Heart Lake Secondary School.
